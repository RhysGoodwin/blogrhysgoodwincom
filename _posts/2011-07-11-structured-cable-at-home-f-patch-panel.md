Here’s a quick update on my [structured cable at home](https://blog.rhysgoodwin.com/home-diy/structured-cable-at-home/). Hopefully it will give you some ideas if you’re looking to do something similar. The main goal here was to run all 4 LNB outputs from my dish and my UFH antenna back to a single point.

[![](/content/uploads/2011/07/CupboardFull.jpg "CupboardFull")](/content/uploads/2011/07/CupboardFull.jpg)RG6 quad-shield run up from the floor through the existing data cable channel.

[![](/content/uploads/2011/07/CablesThroughWall.jpg "CablesThroughWall")](/content/uploads/2011/07/CablesThroughWall.jpg)I used a piece of powder coated aluminum which I cut from a 2U server rack blanking panel and ran the RG6 cables through the wall and terminated them with ‘F’ joiners.

[![](/content/uploads/2011/07/DrillingTemplate.png "DrillingTemplate")](/content/uploads/2011/07/DrillingTemplate.png)I came across a great free 2D CAD application called [DraftSight](http://www.3ds.com/products/draftsight/free-cad-software/) which I used to create a template for drilling the plate and the wall.

Completed and all back together – featuring the aptly named ‘Patch’. The cables connected to the completed patch plate all go back up the channel to the TV Server PC in the cupboard above. I haven’t cabled any of the rooms (except the lounge) because everything is delivered over IP, however I have pre-drilled at the back of the plate and half drilled the plate for future expansion.

I’d like to thank Godfey who supplied all the RG6, F connectors, and tools. And also took the time to show me how to do PPC compression fittings. Kiwi’s – if you’re in need to any of the gear to do this stuff Godfrey trades through [TradeMe](http://www.trademe.co.nz/Members/Listings.aspx?member=1544564) and gives the best service and prices around!
