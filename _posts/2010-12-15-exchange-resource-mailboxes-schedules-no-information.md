Here’s a quick one that might save you some time. Even after installing the Exchange auto accept agent and registering your resource mailboxes against it you still don’t get free/busy information when you go to book the resource.

If these are new resource mailboxes which haven’t yet had a booking all you need to do is create a booking and the free/busy information will start working.
