I don’t really like to do this but here’s a compiled copy of FindPrivateKey.exe. It’s a really uesful tool but Microsoft only provide the source code as part of a development sample.

Details about the tool are here: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa717039.aspx>

Hopefully Microsoft will get annoyed with me distributing this here and put up an official binary.

I compiled it my self this afternoon. At least it’s better than downloading it from some dodgy file-sharing site!

**Requires .NET 3.5**
