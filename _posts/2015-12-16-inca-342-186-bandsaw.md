Here’s a quick video on my “new” Inca Bandsaw.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLgSoyvMWTo?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="640"></iframe></span>

A few facts I missed in the video:

- Model: 342 186 04
- Manufactured: 1986
- Motor: Leroy Somer LS80P 230v
- Relay Start
- Work done: 
    - General clean/de-rust
    - Replaced thrust bearings
    - Fixed lose neutral in wall plug
    - Stripped motor, checked for dust and bearing condition. Ok
    - Replaced capacitor
    - Cleaned dust from start/stop buttons
    - Tracked and tensioned blade

I had an issue with the motor occasionally not starting, it would just hum. I replaced the capacitor and the problem seems to have gone away.

I’m not 100% sure what kind of induction motor this is. When I opened it I excepted to find a centrifugal switch inside but I didn’t. Is it a permanent split capacitor motor? Please comment if you know how it starts/runs. I made this simple wiring diagram. (To the best of my understanding).

The next thing I’ll need to do is build a fence.
