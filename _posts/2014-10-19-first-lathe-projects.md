These are my first little lathe projects. After all, isn’t the point of having a lathe so that you can make improvements to your lathe?

These were made from bits of brass and steel I got from the scrap dealer. The threads were all cut with tap and die. The lathe can cut threads but I cannot (yet).

I don’t yet have a knurling tool so I just put some rings around the outside for grip.

**Replacement Handle for Carriage Wheel**

This is to replace the plastic Carriage handle. Not that there is anything wrong with it. Just for the exercise really.
