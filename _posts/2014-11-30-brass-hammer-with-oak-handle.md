I made this small brass hammer to tap things down on the parallels in the milling vice. I may also use it for driving chisels. The idea of a stubby but weighty brass hammer was inspired by [David Barron’s brass hammers](http://www.davidbarronfurniture.co.uk/david_barron_tools.asp?pg=1&id=4). I like his a lot more but overall I’m happy with how it came out and it was a good chance to combine lathe, mill and wood work.

I designed the handle in sketchup, printed the design, then cut it out and traced around it. I then cut it out with a coping saw. My wife finished the handle with a dye stain and [Briwax](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E4AQHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001E4AQHS&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20&linkId=H2ULVKIGZUTS4AJJ)![](https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=blogrhysgoodw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001E4AQHS). She has way more skill and experience with wood finishes than I do.

The slot in the brass screw was cut on the mill with a [2mm end mill.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AUBEM6M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AUBEM6M&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20&linkId=ZTHWYORMDRQO67CK)![](https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=blogrhysgoodw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00AUBEM6M)
