I know it’s not meant as a definitive technical guide but I had a good laugh when I came across this flow chart in hp’s LeftHand SAN / VMWare vSphere 4 guide.

Or in engineering speak: *“Tighten it up ’til it breaks then back it off half a turn!”*

Sorry if you dropped by with a legitimate question on LUN management! Actually the question in the chart about snapshots and remote copy is very valid and the very first thing you must consider when designing your LUN layout.
