Another mod in my quest for a quiet computer. Iâ€™ve mounted the hard drive using elastic cord and a cheap auto electrical crimp set. This should reduce vibration / noise transfer to the case.

Use pliers to completely open crimp connector.

Measure out a piece of elastic and tidy up the ends with a lighter. Thread a plastic cover on to the elastic. Place the elastic in the widened crimp connector so it sticks out just a tiny bit, this will cause it to mushroom-out when crimped. Fold up the edges of the crimp connector with the pliers then crimp.

Slide the plastic cover on.

Repeat as needed

Elastic should be stretched *just* enough to keep the drive held in place.

This could be implemented in a number of different ways depending on your case
