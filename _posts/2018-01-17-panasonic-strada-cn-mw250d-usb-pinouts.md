In case there was any doubt that you really can find the most ridiculously obscure information on the internetâ€¦.here are the pinouts for the Japanese Panasonic Strada CN-MW250D Navi Headunit (and probably most other models in the range). With a USB extension cable, some header cables and a soldering iron you can make your own cable. The unit works fine with a 16GB flash drive. Not sure what the max size is.
