Here’s my second dovetail box. I made this for my Dad for his birthday. There were three things I wanted to achieve on this project:

**Flush Look**  
On the last box I had a slot for the lid to slide in. This works just fine but I really wanted to make a box which was completely flush all the way round.

**Opening/Closing Dovetail**  
At some point during all my dovetail practice I produced a dovetail joint which wasn’t tight or loose and was able to open and close snugly. This gave me the idea of a dovetail joint as part of an opening/closing mechanism.

**Brass** I’ve been largely focusing on my woodworking skills but ultimately I’m at the beginning of a long journey to build up a wide range of skills across many materials and techniques – not just wood. To kick things off I wanted to include an element of bass on this project. I decided to keep it simple and add a little bass handle for opening the lid.
