Back in January I posted about my [workshop renovation](https://blog.rhysgoodwin.com/home-diy/1-year-workshop-renovation/). Since then I’ve completed the network outlets, wired up the security alarm and built a workbench.

[![](/content/uploads/2013/04/1.BenchConcept.png "BenchConcept")](/content/uploads/2013/04/1.BenchConcept.png)

Initial workbench concept done in Sketchup.

Each leg is a 2×4 and ply torsion box. Well I had to do *something* with all the ply offcuts from [lining the walls!](https://blog.rhysgoodwin.com/home-diy/1-year-workshop-renovation/)

The ply is screwed and glued to the 2×4 box. These [Irwin QuickGrip clamps](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002244S/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00002244S&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogrhysgoodw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00002244S) are super handy.

Yes the bench is built like the proverbial brick house. Several people have made reference to an earthquake or bomb shelter.

I installed a tub with removable insert to save bench space. (Good call Niten!) Not sure when I’ll to get this plumbed in.

3mm steel galv plate for the metalworking area.

[![](/content/uploads/2013/04/12.Routing.jpg "Routing")](/content/uploads/2013/04/12.Routing.jpg)

I wanted the plate to sit flush with the surface of the bench so I routed out 3mm across the surface where the plate goes. 25mm per pass. Sucker for punishment? Perhaps. Actually the top was *ok* – the front – don’t ask. This was done with a [Makita RP1800 Router](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MUAMFE/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002MUAMFE&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogrhysgoodw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002MUAMFE). ‘Like a hot knife through butter’.

I then glued the steel plate in with [Contact Adhesive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FYDUS0/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005FYDUS0&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogrhysgoodw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005FYDUS0)

[![](/content/uploads/2013/04/13.Vice_.jpg "Vice")](/content/uploads/2013/04/13.Vice_.jpg)

This is an original ‘Made in England’ Record vice which I did a quick restoration job on. Very robust.

[These record vices](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JT528/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002JT528&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20) are now sold under the Irwin brand.

My favourite part…What would a workshop be without a server……tool drawer.

[![](/content/uploads/2013/04/17.ServerDraw.jpg "ServerDraw")](/content/uploads/2013/04/17.ServerDraw.jpg)

I’d like to add a few more but who knows when I’ll get around to it. I used a [Bosch Multi tool](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EO8ITK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007EO8ITK&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20) to cut out the little recesses where the rails are mounted. Can highly recommend these.

And yes you can cut through a CD ROM drive with a [Jig Saw](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ELM9GK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008ELM9GK&linkCode=as2&tag=blogrhysgoodw-20)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogrhysgoodw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B008ELM9GK)

It’s already getting messy!
